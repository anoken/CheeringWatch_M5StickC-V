Cheering Watch" to keep an eye on your motions
Getting up in the morning is hard! You live alone, but you need someone to cheer you up! It happens sometimes, doesn't it?
We have created "Cheering Watch," a device that uses the M5StickV's built-in acceleration sensor to estimate your motions and cheer you up according to your motions.
Cheering Watch not only shows you what time it is, but also adds "cheering" to your daily life.
My name is Cheering watch!!
